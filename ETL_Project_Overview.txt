ETL Project Overview
Will, Jeff, & Claudia 

The sources of data that were extracted from:
	① Lego Database: Themes and set CSVs
	② OMDb Database: Box office revenue (API & JSON)

The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc)
•  Cleaning 
	• We needed to further filter the data when joining the movies from the Lego data set 
	  and the OMDb data set because not all of the movies had box office revenue or there 
	  were formatting inconsistencies 

•  Joining
	• Lego Data: Joined theme and set data with a common key (Foreign Key “Theme ID” from Sets 
	  with Unique Key “ID” from Themes)
	• Lego and OMDb Data: Added movies from Lego theme list to OMDb API call

•  Filtering
	• Created a loop to parse out specific parameter (box office revenue) from JSON for each movie
	  as well as error checking to ensure that the box office field existed and did not introduce
	  an error 
	• Hand picked movies out of Lego theme list to reduce amount of data and error reduction on 
	  API calls

•  Database Selection 
	  Selected RDBMS based on the logical relationship between the data sets and that each data
	  set was already standardized.
